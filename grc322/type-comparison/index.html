        <h1>URW DIN vs. Interstate </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Interstate is a san-serif font that was designed by Tobia Frere-Jones in the 1993-1999 time frame. The font was licensed by the Font Bureau. Interstate was modeled heavily off of Style Type E, which was a signage font drawn for the US by Theodore Forbes. The wide spacing of Interstate makes it best suited for display usage in print. Some notable characteristics of the font are the terminals of ascending and descending strokes that are cut at an angle, and the curved stroke terminals that are drawn at 90 degree angle to stroke, positioning them at an angle to the baseline.</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->

			 <h3> URW DIN was designed by Volker Schnebel and was created in 1984. It has up to 48 typefaces, has 20 variations and can be used for 21 languages. The font family was first used on railroad cars in Germany. It was then commissioned to be used for German public administration and signage. It is best known for the usability to convey clear messages whether thatâ€™s through headlines or fine print. The typeface allows designers to create designs that are fun, but also professional. One reason for its popularity is how it can be used in any context. That is why DIN has been so successful as a font.</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

			 <figure>
				<img src="ascender-descender.jpg"
					 alt="Comparison of the two fonts with the ascenders and descenders.">
				<figcaption>Comparing the uppercase 'E' between Interstate and URW DIN, the ligatures have different distances. In DIN (right), the ligature reaches the width of the top and bottom stroke. In comparison, the ligature in Interstate (left) is shorter than the letter's width.</figcaption>

				<img src="ligature.jpg"
					 alt="Comparison of the ligatures in letter E.">
				<figcaption>Interstate differs from URW DIN in the sense that some of the ascenders or descenders utilize a slant rather than a straight line.</figcaption>

             <figure>
				<img src="M.png"

				<figcaption>The middle stroke in an uppercase 'M' touches the baseline in Interstate (left), but the middle stroke for URW DIN (right) floats above the baseline.</figcaption>

				<img src="j-g.jpg"
					 alt="Letters J and G in comparison to each other.">
				<figcaption>The descenders on the Interstate typeface fall short of the width of the letter. In comparison, the URW DIN descender matches the width of the letter.</figcaption>

				<img src="Q.jpg"
					 alt="Comparison of the tails on the Q.">
				<figcaption>In the uppercase letter 'Q', the tails are written in a different angle. The Interstate (left) tail's angle is more vertical whereas the URW DIN (right) tail is more horizontally angled. </figcaption>

				<img src="b.jpg"
					 alt="Lowercase b comparison.">
				<figcaption>With Interstate on the left and URW DIN on the right, the counters in the letter, "b" differ. The counter in Interstate is not fully rounded and has sharp corners. URW DIN is fully rounded.</figcaption>

				<img src="number.png"
