              <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p> 
                    We are so proud of our shop, Sip of Sunshine Coffee. We spent over 10 years dreaming, planning, learning and working in all things coffee with the hope that someday we would start a shop of our own.

                    In January of 2014, we launched Sip of Sunshine Coffee on Garden Street in Downtown San Luis Obispo. A year later, we rolled up the doors to our roasting company, Sunny Coffee Roasters.  In August of 2016, we opened our second Sunshine location on Foothill Boulevard near Cal Poly.  We now have over 40 wonderful employees, and love that you have made Sunshine one of the most sought after destinations on the Central Coast. Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible.

                    Our goal has always been to create inspiring spaces, with great people and amazing products, in a way that truly adds value to the community around us.

                    We hope you love it here.
