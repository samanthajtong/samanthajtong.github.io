                <p> 
                    Here at Sunshine, we've been making happy coffee since January of   2014.

                    The combination of our own daily scratch made pastries, craft roasted coffee, house made syrups and almond milk, beautiful spaces, our carefully curated boutiques, and service with a smile makes stepping into Sunshine a memorable and magical experience that is sure to brighten your day.

                    In the time since opening, we've won "Best Coffee Shop" in both local polls every year, and have been written about by The New York Times, Sunset Magazine, The Guardian, Alton Brown, The Venue Report, AAA Westways Magazine, Sweet Paul, and many more.  In 2017, we were awarded "Business of the Year" at the Capital for California's 35th Assembly District.

                    We are so honored that you have made Sunshine the most sought after coffee destination on the Central Coast.

                    Thank you for stopping by.
