					<h1>Our story</h1>
				
					<p>Lavender Jewelry started in 2014 with the intentions of creating pieces that are ethically sourced, but as reasonably priced it could be. Our store has become a local favorite and has since been able to find more and more ethical sources for the jewelry. As we grow bigger, we love to partner with local businesses and donate to organizations that align with Lavender Jewelry's values.</p>
