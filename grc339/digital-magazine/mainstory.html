                            <h2> Top Must-See Musicals turned into Movies!</h2>
                    
                                <p>Some of the best musical films date back to the 1960s and 70s, when one of the most prominent film genres was the musical. It seemed Disney couldn't animate a movie without throwing in an amazing song and live-action films were having difficulty moving away from a format more familiar to theater. Over time, the musical genre died out for less whimsical fare, but it didn't go away. A revival of sorts has embraced Hollywood with Academy Awards getting thrown around for top musical films like Chicago, La La Land, and Les Misérables. The format didn't stick solely to the silver screen either—there are some fantastic musical shows on the small screen as well.</p>

                                <p>Universal has released the first trailer for the “Dear Evan Hansen” movie, premiering in theaters on Sept. 24.

                                Ben Platt returns in his Tony-winning titular role in the big-screen adaptation of the Broadway musical hit created by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

                                “Dear Evan Hansen” follows Evan Hansen, an anxious and isolated high school student who writes letters to himself. Evan’s classmate Connor Murphy gets a hold of one of his letters and dies by suicide with the note in his pocket, leading Connor’s parents to believe it was a suicide note addressed to Evan. Soon, Evan gets caught in a complicated lie, pretending to have been Connor’s friend and forming a fabricated relationship with the Murphy family.</p>

                                <p>“Dear Evan Hansen” opened on Broadway in December 2016 and quickly became a fan-favorite. The musical also dominated the awards circuit, taking home six Tony Awards, including best musical and best actor in a musical for Platt. The original Broadway cast album, which includes the catchy songs “You Will Be Found,” “Waving Through a Window” and “Sincerely, Me,” also won a Grammy.</p>

                                <p>It's finally time to head to Washington Heights—Lin-Manuel Miranda's long-anticipated movie-musical, In the Heights, arrived on June 10. The film, based on Miranda's first Tony-winning hit, tells the story of a rapidly gentrifying block in New York's Washington Heights and the people who live there. The movie was delayed a full year due to the pandemic, but it's now coming to screens both big and small. </p>
                        
                                <p>On June 9, In the Heights premiered at various indoor and outdoor screenings as part of the Tribeca Film Festival. As COVID-19 rates are beginning to subside and vaccination rates are rising, the movie is also having a theatrical release, which began on June 10.</p>

                                <p>If you never caught a theater performance of the Tony Award-winning hip-hop musical Hamilton, you can finally get great seats by streaming a filmed 2016 performance of the original cast on Disney Plus at home. Originally intended for theatrical release, the film ended up on Disney Plus after cinemas around the world closed due to the pandemic. </p>
                        
                                <p>Watching it on Disney Plus costs a fraction of a theater ticket, but it isn't free -- the streaming service stopped offering free trials before premiering Hamilton in July, so you must sign up for a paid subscriber account in order to see it (read on for more details).
